# Gacha S Mods
 
Fixes all design issues with s-modding, 100% guaranteed. Ãœ

## Okay fine, a more concrete explanation:
- Creates a dummy 0 cost hullmod that, when built-in, builds in a random non-hidden s-mod.
- Blocks building in all other hullmods by default. So if you want s-mods, they have to be randomized.
- That's literally it.

### Other gameplay changes
- S-modding will grant a random amount of bonus XP so you can't predict what hullmod you're going to get from that.
- I added a hullmod category so you can find the hullmod easier (it defaults to sitting at the bottom). it's kinda ugly but what can you do
- literally it but actually.

## Options (found in settings.json)
- True random mode: will randomly choose (almost) any non-hiddenEverywhere hullmod for s-modding. (maybe you get Targeting Supercomputer, maybe you get Axial Rotation)
- Only known hullmods: will only build in hullmods known by the player (off by default because then why would you learn Shield Shunt/High Scatter Amp?)
